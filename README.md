# AgileTrailWeather

This is an Android App, used to retrieve weather data based on a US zipcode entered by the user.

Once the App is installed, the user will be provided with an EditText, to enter a valid zipcode.

The EditText is followed by a SUBMIT button, which helps the user navigate to the next screen that has the weather details requested.

The second screen provides the user with all the details for the zipcode provided on Screen1.

If the user enters an invalid zipcode, a Toast message is shown mentioning the same.

On screen2 the user will find:

  Current Weather, with a brief description
  Temperature
  
  Wind speed, Pressure, Humidity, Sunrise time and the City Name at the bottom left.
  
  NOTE: THE WEATHER DATA IS POPULATED FROM THE WEATHER MAP API
